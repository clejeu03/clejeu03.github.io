As an organization which often presents virtual reality demos, we have regularly the opportunity to witness the very first immersion of several different people, and this puts us in the first line to gather opinions and first reactions. There are some basics to know for taking some stranger into his first tour in virtual reality, and to help this person to make the best out of the experience. The following are what we learnt and try to apply, there are many others guidelines that we don't know, as we are ourselves developers and used to virtual reality. The point of these guidelines is to keep beside a virtual reality demonstration a moment of humanity with the user. 

Youngers 

- As there are used to digital interactions on smartphone / tablets / computers / gaming consoles, there is no need for you to explain the steps to start the virtual reality experience. If there has been some user oriented design behind the development, young users will simply look around for clues and fond by themselves how the application is working. Apart if you have a very specific way of interacting inside the experience, juste let them search and try ! If it not obvious to them, even after your explanations, better rethink the UX of the application.

- Children under 13 are not advised to use headsets. First of all, the space between lens is adapted to adults and not to children. Under 13, children have a smaller inter-pupillary distance than adults and forcing their eyes into a non-adapted headset could cause permanent vision disability in worst case. In addition, some VR content is obviously not adapted to children. And last point, they should not be immersed too long in virtual reality, as we don't know yet the long-term effects of such an experience. So when children come to you to test a VR app, first of all, inform the parents of the risks and even if they don't care, explain them why it is dangerous for their kids. The point of doing that is to start to educate famillies about the use of virtual reality, with that technology becoming more and more known. Our solution is to make the children try a cardboard like Homido, that can really customize the inter-lens distance, instead of a Gear or an Oculus.

As for the quick takeway of user's feedbacks we received :

 - the motion sickness was due to the developers ! Apart from extreme and well-known inconsistencies, there are globally a lot less nausea and discomfort. Three years ago, motion sickness was the dragon every VR developer was affraid of. Nowadays, 1 person out of 10 or maybe 15 among our new users, experiences motion sickness. Why is that ? Because developers learnt from their mistakes and started to offer well suited navigation and exploration means. The list of direct-path-to-sickness interfaces and interactions is well known and avoided. 

 - For many people, "Oculus" is a commun noun for all the virtual reality headset, or the "dark box you put on your head to see stuff". They do make the difference between a headset that uses a smartphone and a headset that uses a computer. When we unmount the S7 from the Gear, they suddenly figure it out and ask the difference bewteen both. But as the answer is based on technical specifications, they don't fully get it. 

 - There are few experiences more social than a virtual reality test. We often see friends or family making fun of the user while his is turning around to see an invisible object, or when he expresses feelings like surprise, joy or fear. Discussions, pictures, and even tactile interactions happen around and with the user.  

 - Sometimes, not very often, people remove the headset, looking at us with a real deep astonishement, and saying that the potential is huge, that this new media opens the door to borderless possibilities for that or that other experiences. We are so happy when someones tell us that, and to guide him to buy one, or get more informations. It is for us a special experience to witness the before and the after of a new VR beleiver ! Most of the case, users are happy, but they react like they did for the Kinect I thing : they want it into their living room to play some stuff at friday nights with friends, but they do not forecast the other applications.

And always explain to the people that nothing is better than the experience of a virtual reality application. 

"I hear and I forget. I see and I remeber. I do and I understand. " Confucius
Confucius wasn't exactly thinking about virtual reality and he said that I guess, but anyway it applies perfectly to it. "Doing" a virtual reality experience is the only way to understand it.

- les gens viennent principalement tester la technologie quand ils savent qu’on est là. A aucun moment le contenu n’est intéressant. Et par voie de conséquence ils jugent du hardware par le contenu qu’ils ont testé. Ceux qui ont testé plusieurs expériences entrevoient la valeur ajoutée d’un contenu par rapport à un autre mais ne se rendent pas compte qu’il faut adapter au casque et à ses controllers s’il y en a.


- bien souvent, ceux qui n’ont pas du tout aimé l’expérience (et ne nous le disent pas on le voit à leur expression on l’entend quand ils le disent à leurs amis en sortant) n’ont pas compris le gameplay ou ont été mis face à un bug et n’ont pas compris que c’était un bug, ou alors n’ont pas osé demander de l’aide aux bénévoles. La timidité face à aux bénévoles est un problème de notre fait, et nous devons travailler sur la mise en confiance des testeurs dans ce sens.
