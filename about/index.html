        <h4>About</h4>
        <p> Fallen in VR in the last few years, I had opportunities to experiment/develop it in a research laboratory, in a private research and development center, and in many games jams too. My passion is between the human and the technology, in the interface that allows them to connect and communicate to each other. I am the happy president of a non-profit organization that tries to make the virtual reality technology available for everyone, with the aim to teach people what it is and how to use it. I also have a dream to let my entrepreneurial mind lead my professional life and to change the world of course ! I have many ideas and too few times to craft them, but I keep trying. </p>

        <p>I have interests in robotics, computer vision, small hacks to augment real world objects, nice UX/UI, art and design. I love to say that I'm a creative engineer.</p>
