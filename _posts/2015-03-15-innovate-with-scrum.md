In RIT Paris, we use an adapted Scrum Method to manage our development. Here is why we decided to use it and how to adapt the standard Scrum to a Research and Development process like we have. 

### Why we decided to use Scrum ?
The Agile Methods are used by many developers worldwide, in small teams as well as in very big teams. Those methods have proven themselves efficient for the developers, for the clients and for the manager to get the product delivered in time and accordingly to the client's need. The Scrum Method is the most known among those Agile Methods. The iterative aspect of this method allow the team to be flexible and to respond to change in times and to provide high quality with a smart prioritization of tasks.

There are three pillars that need to be reminded to every member of a scrum team : 
1. **The Feedbacks** : the continuous measure of progresses is the key to find a match between user requirements and the team capacities
2. **The Demos** : each and every sprint must be closed with a visual/runnable demo so everyone, client and team, can see the work's progresses
3. **The Cross-Functionnal** Team : every member is involved from the beginning to the end of the project, regardless of his skills and background

### Prior to a new Scrum process
It all begins with an idea, right ? In RIT we decided that if a member have a new idea, then this member becomes automatically Project Manager of this project. Scrum is meant for teams approximately from 3 to 8 people, so you can't launch your project alone.
