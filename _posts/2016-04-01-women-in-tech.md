For celebrating women who work in tech, Google organize each year around the world a gathering of local women to share role model. This event was a success as it contributed to create a community from a group of women who didn't heard about the Women Techmaker organization before entering the event. 

As a women in tech myself, I wanted to take advantage of my little space on the web to share my different experiences about beeing a woman in a computer science school, in a research laboratory and in a R&D center.
